# Tuxedo

This Elixir application is a clone of [Trello](https://trello.com) -- a popular project management tool. It makes use of the [Phoenix framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react) to serve board views. This is primarily an excuse to explore the viability of Elixir as a programming language.

To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
